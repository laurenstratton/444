        <summary><b>5 Things to Try When You Cant Stop Overthinking</b></summary>
            <ol>
                <li><i>Remember that you are not your thoughts</i></li>
                <p>You are creating the thoughts in your mind. And because you have the ability to create these worrisome, fearful thoughts, you also have the ability to create positive, uplifting thoughts.</p>

                <li><i>After youve replayed the same scenario in your head dozens of times, ask yourself if its useful anymore.</i></li>
                <p>Sure, its useful to think through possible scenarios so you have a game plan, but then, leave it there. Once youre thinking about it for the 19th time, youre not being productive anymore. Youre obsessing over it.</p>

                <li><i>Remember, you cant control the situation. You can only control your reaction to it.</i></li>
                <p>We often blame people or circumstances for upsetting us & “ruining our day.” Actually, no one and nothing has the power to ruin our day because we are viewing life from our own lens. We have the power to choose if something is going to upset us or if were going to let it roll off our back.</p>

                <li><i>“Worry is a prayer to chaos.” -Gabby Bernstein</i></li>
                <p>When you’re constantly worrying & thinking about what could go wrong, it’s all you’re focused on. As a result, you’re going to notice more of what’s wrong, perpetuating the overthinking. When you instead focus on what’s working well in your life, you’ll begin to notice more of that. 
                </p>

                <li><i>You can tell yourself a new story.</i></li>
                <p>Similar to the first point, you create your thoughts. As humans, we’re designed to look for danger and threat. However, we’re also designed to dream and have the capacity to feel good. Change your fearful, negative story into something that feels better. </p>
