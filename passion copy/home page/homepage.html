            <p>Nowadays, we are bombarded with information about mental health and trauma from every direction, whether it is on Tiktok, Instagram, Facebook, or any other social media platform. Overconsumption and often misleading information can be overwhelming and confusing, especially when the information is not always true. My goal is to share the knowledge i've gained on my ongoing healing journey with you. The research is ongoing and aims to be informative & easy to understand. </p>
