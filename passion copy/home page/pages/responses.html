                <li>“I want to listen to you, but I’m starting to take your feedback personally. This discussion will be more constructive if I have a chance to calm myself first.”</li> <br>
                <li>“I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed right now. It would really help me to hear you’re on my side and that you care about me.”</li> <br>
                <li>“It’s hard for me to understand ‘you-statements’ because my brain thinks I’m being attacked. Can you try using ‘I-statements’ when giving me feedback?”</li> <br>
                <li>“I’m noticing myself becoming defensive. Can we re-start this conversation? I’ll try to be more mindful of my words this time.”</li> <br>
                <li>“I’m starting to feel angry. I’m going to take some space right now so I don’t say anything hurtful. I’ll come back to check in with you in 20 min.”</li> <br>
